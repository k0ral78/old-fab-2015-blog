<p>This has been a bad week. I have done a little draft of the logo of my project 
but I haven’t completed it because I’d like to do the press fit. I have done 
many errors with cardboard and laser cutting. All the tests were time 
consuming and in the end I haven’t completed a press fit construction kit. My 
best result was being able to bend the cardboard without burning it or breaking 
it while bending it. Here below my week experience.  </p>

<p><br />  </p>

<h4 id="my-vinyl-cutter-experience"><strong>My vinyl cutter experience</strong></h4>
<p>(to be completed..)</p>

<p>This week we have to try the vinyl cutter. Last week I haven’t tried to use 
Inkscape because I wanted to try 3D CAD. Now it is the opportunity and the right 
motivation.<br />
First I followed some basic tutorials:  </p>

<p><a href="https://inkscape.org/doc/elements/tutorial-elements.html">Tutorial 
elements</a>
<a href="https://inkscape.org/doc/basic/tutorial-basic.html">Basic tutorial</a><br />
Later I found another tutorial to draw something related to my final project: a 
fish!  </p>

<p><a href="http://verysimpledesigns.com/vectors/inkscape-tutorial-cartoon-fish.html">Tutorial Inkscape 
fish</a> </p>

<p>In the end I did a funny fish  </p>

<p><img src="/img/fish_5.jpg" alt="fish made with inkscape" width="200" height="200" /><br />
<br />  </p>

<p>This fish is not suitable to be cut with vinyl cutter. I have to modify it. 
Time flows so I have to think about the press fit construction kit which is the 
real assignment of this week.</p>

<p><br />  </p>

<h4 id="my-laser-cutting-experience"><strong>My laser cutting experience</strong></h4>
<p>(to be completed..)  </p>

<p>First of all I will show the laser cutting machine we have at Fablab Cascina  </p>

<p><img src="/img/3rd-week/Image00005.jpg" alt="laser cutting machine" />  </p>

<p>I like when you turn it on, it looks like you turn on a nuclear reactor. No, I 
haven’t ever seen a nuclear reactor :)  </p>

<p>In the beginning I tried some joints. The first one was the simplest one but 
problems hide even in the simplest things. It was a useful test to understand 
the basis. 
Anyway, let’s start with errors!<br />
The first joint is the simplest one but I missed something about the kerf..As 
you can see below  </p>

<p><img src="/img/3rd-week/Image00001.jpg" alt="first cardboard cut" /><br />
<img src="/img/3rd-week/Image00002.jpg" alt="first bad joint front view" /><br />
<img src="/img/3rd-week/Image00003.jpg" alt="first bad joint lateral view" />  </p>

<p>I had to think more about the kerf and I took the caliper to have the 
cardboard thickness. You can’t see the numbers because they blink then it was 
difficult to take the picture.  </p>

<p><img src="/img/3rd-week/Image00004.jpg" alt="caliper" />  </p>

<p>The <strong>thickness of the cardboard is 6,25mm</strong>. According to the thickness I did 
the “female” joint of the cardboard 6,05mm. <strong>Remeber</strong>, you have to consider 
<strong>0,2mm</strong> for the kerf. If you want to consider the kerf in the “male” part 
you have to increase your measure, that is 0,2mm more. Finally the joint fits. 
Ok with the kerf, but.. <br />
<img src="/img/3rd-week/Image00007.jpg" alt="second joint kerf ok but not depth" />  </p>

<p>As you can see above I didn’t consider the depth of my joint.<br />
Again..more job with Inkscape and finally below there is my first joint that 
works!  </p>

<p><img src="/img/3rd-week/Image00010.jpg" alt="second joint kerf ok depth ok" />  </p>

<p>Now that I was the master of a simple joint ;) I wanted to complicate things 
but unfortunately time was not my friend. I did some tests on two more 
complicated joints but I was not successful.<br />
<br />  </p>

<p>I liked the idea of a snap fit joint. You can see an example of animated gif 
image on the first page of this file (I was not able to extract the gif from the 
.ppt file). <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/MIT/961.04/people/will/Snap_fit.ppt">snap fit ppt 
file</a>  </p>

<p>The first snap fit joint was not so bad but it moves too much.  </p>

<p><img src="/img/3rd-week/Image00008.jpg" alt="third snap fit joint" /><br />
<img src="/img/3rd-week/Image00009.jpg" alt="third snap fit joint doesn't fit so well" />  </p>

<p>Trying to do a snap fit which doesn’t move too much I did a larger base 
but..if the base of the “triangle” is too thick the cardboard can’t bend in the 
right way.<br />
<img src="/img/3rd-week/Image00012.jpg" alt="fouth snap fit joint (more compact)" />  </p>

<p>I saw a different snap fit joint with thicker base but..too thin. 
<img src="/img/3rd-week/Image00014.jpg" alt="third complicated joint fit not so well" />  </p>

<p>All these test were very time consuming. Even if a bit frustrating, I liked 
very much thinking and testing the joints but I had to think about a press fit 
construction kit.<br />
I saw a nice job 
<a href="http://fabacademy.org/archives/2013/students/olafsson.bjartur/week3.html">here</a>
. I wanted to test the technique to bend the cardboard (and even the wood) with 
those little incisions. My local instructor suggested me to do a similar 
box for a speaker. I liked the idea and I started to learn how to bend the 
cardboard.
 <img src="  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/3.5_Inch_Speaker.jpg " alt="audio speaker" width="640" height="480" />  </p>

<p>Bending the cardboard was a nightmare for me..  </p>

<p>BE CAREFUL! If you do the lines too near and you don’t consider laser power you 
risk your life..  </p>

<p><img src="/img/3rd-week/Image00015.jpg" alt="bending cardboard first little fire" /></p>

<p><img src="/img/3rd-week/Image00016.jpg" alt="bending cardboard big fire" />  </p>

<p>After this shocking images, I have to describe some technical details.<br />
If you want to use incision you have to draw the lines with a different color 
(usually red) and then you have to change the parameters to use with that 
color. 
Here is a summary of the parameters I remember. 
When you draw a line you have to give a <strong>stroke width of 0,01mm</strong> otherwise 
the laser will pass many times on the same line and you risk to turn fire on.  </p>

<p><strong>I used a cardboard which was thick from 6,25mm to 6,85mm.</strong>  </p>

<p>When I did the incision I gave the laser a power <strong>from 15% to 17%</strong>. </p>

<p>When I wanted to cut my cardboard I gave a power of <strong>60%</strong>. I found this is 
the right one that allow me to take away my pieces from rest of the cardboard. </p>

<p>I did some tests and in the end I found the right power to bend the cardboard.</p>

<p>Here below there is a screenshot where you can see the different colors of the 
lines. I increased stroke width just to do a visible line. The 0,01mm stroke 
width is really difficult to see in a screenshot..<br />
<img src="/img/3rd-week/project-incision0.jpg" alt="project incision" />  </p>

<p><br />  </p>

<p>After the fire, I reduced the distance of the lines and the power of the laser 
to <strong>10%</strong>. My local instructor told me to try to do little cuts instead of 
incision. Here below you can see that the lines are black and not red as with 
the incision.  </p>

<p><img src="/img/3rd-week/project-cut1.jpg" alt="screnshot little cuts" />  </p>

<p><br />  </p>

<p>I tested it but as you can see below, when I tried to bend the cardboard it 
broke in two parts.<br />
<img src="/img/3rd-week/Image00017.jpg" alt="broken cardboard" />  </p>

<p>I was nearly to give up and to write that cardboard was not the right 
material to use with this technique of bending BUT..the last test was the most 
successful one. I found a cardboard with different thickness (<strong>6.85mm</strong>) so I 
decided to increase the power of the laser a little bit (<strong>17%</strong>). I 
also increased a little bit the distance between the lines as you can see 
below. You have to compare the screenshot below with the other one above with 
the red lines.  </p>

<p><img src="/img/3rd-week/project-incision1.jpg" alt="project incision last" /><br />
<br />  </p>

<p>The result is quite encouraging. I could bend the cardboard without any effort 
and the joints fit quite well. In this last test I re-drew the incision lines 
again and there is one thing I haven’t understood. Why if I did the red lines 
with 0,01mm thickness the laser passes on them twice? I know that this helped 
with the incision and that this is the reason because of the cardboard bended 
better than before. I think I have to do more tests. </p>

<p><br />  </p>

<h4 id="conclusions"><strong>Conclusions</strong></h4>

<p>In the end I am not satisfied about my job this week. I hope I will have 
more time in the next weeks. Furthermore I am not so satisfied about Inkscape. 
I noticed that if I set one dimension, it is not so uncommon that when I check 
it again it changed a little bit and this is so frustrating. Anyway I 
definitely have to do more practice and I have to use Inkscape or test some 
other 2D tools in the next weeks.  </p>
