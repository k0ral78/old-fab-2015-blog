<p>GITHUB: no problem. Nice tutorials
MERCURIAL: no problem</p>

<p>What i This week:
I always would have wanted to learn doing a simple website. Fab Academy has been the right personal motivation. I would have more time to make my blog nicer, but during this semester I’ll definitely do it. 
I loved the way of thinking of Neil about working at “low level” also because I like to understand how things work in depth. I like working with a simple text editor (I chose Geany [link] but I also like nano on command-line). I like command-line also because I started working on  old Commode64 and I remember I also had an old Olivetti 286 [http://www.computergraffiti.it/pcs286/pcs286g.jpg]. Obviuosly I played sometime with MS-DOS[http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS] and then a little bit with Linux. Now I really want to go in depth with Linux. 
I found some difficulties about choosing my final project. Here it is the list of the projects I thought 
-	Auto sat finder tracking: a platform on which you can put a dish antenna and automatically it point to the right satellite. 
-	Portable mobile radio bridge: I thought about something very light to carry and. A mountable light trellis wooden made, something like a kit. Eventually with motors to help to lift up higher. Obviously an auto point system with the other far end of radio bridge.
-	A mobile platform which is able to go even in the worst countryside. Eventually autonomous with an auto “back home” system when battery goes low. Obviously it has to stream video in real-time and you also can drive it remotely.
-	A rechargeable wireless system: I like the idea to go in depth on induction recharge.
-	I also like the wireless sensor networks, even because I studied them. Regarding this idea I hope that I will be able to do a wearable underwater network. It could be useful to monitor scuba divers during immersion.
-	I also would have liked to do some toys for children. I think that it is very funny and I’d like to do a funny toy for my nephew  Anyway, my project could be even a very funny toy :)
-	I liked the pick and place machine for SMD electronics components [http://academy.cba.mit.edu/2012/students/rodriguez.alejandro/project%20presentation.html]
-	Video entryphone for my parent’s house. In the last months I am a little bit worried about thefts in the house. In general I’d like to go in depth in home security systems which can give a feeling of more safety. For this reason I installed some IP cam in my house but we still don’t have a video door phone.</p>
