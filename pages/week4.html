<p><br /><br />
This week was a good week! I thought that soldering SMD electronic components 
was more difficult but in the end everything works at the first attempt. My 
local instructor told me that it was a stroke of luck :) In the past I had a 
little experience with the solderer but I never soldered SMD electronic 
components. I liked the sequence of teaching first the production and after the 
design of electronic. I think that when you put your hands on then you will be 
more motivated to design. I mean that when you design and you haven’t ever seen 
anything of electronic components, you haven’t ever put your hands on the 
solderer and the electronic components, you will be quite bored to pay 
attention when someone explains to you something that is very tangible and you 
have never seen it. I think that it could be even frustrating. Obviously I am 
talking about my academic experience when I studied always 
on books and if you were lucky you colud use a computer simulator. Anyway, 
this week we have to product hte FabISP key which will be very useful to 
program the Attiny microcontroller without buying any other (expensive) 
electronic device. Here below my weekly report.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="milling-machine"><strong>Milling machine</strong></h4>
<p>Here it is the Roland MDX-20 milling machine at our Fablab. You can see the 
copper plate ready to be etched.</p>

<p><img src="/img/4th-week/20150219_200342.jpg" alt="Roland MX-20 milling machine" /></p>

<p>There are two end mills we used: the one on the right was used to etch and 
the one on the left was used to drill.</p>

<p><img src="/img/4th-week/20150219_200536.jpg" alt="end mill" /></p>

<p>The first thing you have to do is to learn how to change the end mill. There is 
a very little screw and a little wrench to do it. You need patience and you 
have to be very careful because you can easily break the tip of the end mill.<br />
After you put the 1/64 end mill you can disable the <em>view mode</em> on the 
Roland then you have to lower the tip with up/down buttons in such a way that 
the tip can go about one centimeter down (one centimeter of stroke). Now you 
can send the coordinates to the milling machine using the fabmodule panel. You 
can see <em>xmin</em> and <em>ymin</em> below. I took the picture when the machine was 
working, I’ll explain it better below.</p>

<p><img src="/img/4th-week/20150219_201951.jpg" alt="fabmodule panel" /></p>

<p>After you send the coordinates you have to lower the tip until it touches the 
copper base. In this way you give the zero to the <em>z axis</em>.<br />
Now we can better describe the fabmodule panel. First of all you have to select 
the right end mill from the drop down menu. You can see <em>mill traces 1/64</em> in 
the top center of the picture. When you select it, many parameters are 
loaded and you can see them in the bottom of the picture. Above all you can 
see <em>z(mm)</em> that is 0.1mm. This is how much the tip will go down to etch the 
copper base. Afterwards you have to load the picture of the circuit. As I wrote 
in the first lines of this page, this week the assignment is electronic 
production then we have a ready picture to load. The picture of the circuit is 
the one in black and white in fabmodule panel. You can see a detailed 
picture <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/content/projects/fabispkey/hw/fabispkey/
fab_mod/fabisp_cmp.png">here</a>
All you can see in black will be etched. After a quick check to 
the parameters (we didn’t modify anything) you have to click on:<br />
1. <code>make path</code><br />
2. <code>make .rml</code><br />
3. <code>send it</code></p>

<p>Before you click on <em>send it</em> you can check (on the right side of the 
fabmodule panel) if the created paths cross each other. You can zoom as much as 
you want. After these steps the last thing before the start of the process is 
clicking on the <code>Begin milling</code> button and…you can see in the 
<a href="http://youtu.be/q53hv-zqN5Y">video</a> what will happen. You can also follow the 
etching process in the fabmodule panel. The red line is updated to show you 
what is going to be etched.</p>

<p>When the milling machine starts, what you have to check is that white dust you 
can also see in the picture below</p>

<p><img src="/img/4th-week/20150219_201824.jpg" alt="white dust" /></p>

<p>You also have to pay attention to the sound of the milling machine while it is 
working. If you hear some strange sounds maybe that when you set the tip or 
when you set the copper base you did something wrong. When you set the tip you 
haven’t to press too much on the copper base. When you set the copper base you 
have to do in such a way that it has to be perfectly horizontal. If you do 
something wrong you could hear some strange noises and it is better you stop 
the milling machine and you check everything again. The white dust without 
strange noises is a good way to confirm that you did everything in the right 
way.<br />
After all, I changed the end mill with the 1/32 one in order to drill the 
copper. Here below there is a similar screenshot of the fabmodule panel. 
Obviously you have to load the other picture and you have to change the 
selection in the drop down menu with 1/32. You can notice that now the <em>bot 
z(mm)</em> is -1.7mm which means that the tip will go lower and it will drill the 
copper base.</p>

<p><img src="/img/4th-week/20150219_202948.jpg" alt="fabmodule panel for drilling" /></p>

<p>At the end of this process with the milling machine I producted this</p>

<p><img src="/img/4th-week/20150219_203601.jpg" alt="Fab ISP key just drilled" /></p>

<p>In the picture above you can notice little imperfections. For example on 
the right end of the key you can see little pieces of copper. It is better 
to remove them to be sure that when you will use the key everything works fine. 
This little pieces of copper can create short-circuits.</p>

<h4 id="soldering"><strong>Soldering</strong></h4>

<p>Let’s start with soldering stage. First of all, as my local instructor 
suggested, I read this fun and short book <a href="http://www.siliconfarmers.com/smtmanga/">Soldering it’s easier than you 
think</a>. It was interesting but it 
shows you nearly the same suggestions Neil gave use during the lesson.</p>

<p>This is our soldering station</p>

<p><img src="/img/4th-week/20150222_173348.jpg" alt="soldering station" /></p>

<p>There is also the hot air gun to desolder. I never used it before and I was a 
little scared, but it was very useful because I did some errors..</p>

<p>I used the BOM (Bill Of Materials) in <a href="http://fabacademy.org/archives/2014/students/basile.fiore/images/week04/
fabisp_bom.jpg">my local instructor 
page</a></p>

<p><img src="/img/4th-week/fabisp_bom.jpg" alt="BOM" /></p>

<p>The first thing to solder is the microcontroller. Following Neil’s 
advices (which are the same of the book) you have to put some tin on 
the copper and then you put the microcontroller on it. In this way the micro 
will not move when you will solder the rest of the pins.<br />
Here is a picture where you can see the first pin fixed.</p>

<p><img src="/img/4th-week/20150219_210101.jpg" alt="soldering first pin" /></p>

<p>Afterwards, with a lot of patience, i soldered the other pins. You can notice 
too much tin on the first pin because you have to solder the first pin again 
after all the others. I was not so good with the first pin.</p>

<p><img src="/img/4th-week/20150219_213100.jpg" alt="micro soldered" /></p>

<p>In order to verify the connection I used the tester (unfortunately I haven’t 
the picture here) and <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/content/projects/fabispkey/hw/fabispkey/
fab_mod/fabisp_cmp.png">this 
picture</a>.</p>

<p>Here is my first error! In this 
<a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/content/projects/fabispkey/index.html">page</a> was 
looking at
<a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/content/projects/fabispkey/hw/fabisplokey/
docs/fabisp_tbrd.png">this image</a> which was related to FabISPlokey then i soldered the 
wrong capacitor. Where i have to solder C4 I soldered C1. The 
wrong capacitor is the white one below. The right image to follow is <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/content/projects/fabispkey/hw/fabispkey/docs/
fabisp_tbrd.png">this 
one</a></p>

<p><img src="/img/4th-week/20150221_192444.jpg" alt="wrong capacitor" /></p>

<p>What a perfect opportunity to use hot air gun! With the hot air gun you have 
to be really careful to your hands! I desoldered the capacitor without harming 
myself and I continued to solder the other components. In the end I soldered 
everything but I did another (undocumented) error. I solder the diode in the 
wrong way. The diode has a very little line to specify which is the cathode. I 
knew it but distracted and I soldered it in the wrong way. Another great 
oppportunity to use the hot air gun! :) Finally, here is my FabISP key!</p>

<p><img src="/img/4th-week/20150222_173307.jpg" alt="all components soldered" /></p>

<p>In order to have the right thickness to connect it to the USB port I cut and 
added a piece of an old credit card.</p>

<p><img src="/img/4th-week/20150222_175421.jpg" alt="FabISP key with thickness" /></p>

<p>The last step is to program the FabISP. You can use another FabISP 
key or some other commercial devices. You have to connect the FabISP 
key to the other one and following the last lines of the <a href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/electronics_production/index.html">assignment 
page</a> you 
can easily program it IF you were lucky (like me) and you soldered everything 
in the right way. The steps to program the FabISP are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>download and extract the firmware</li>
  <li>go inside the directory</li>
  <li><code>make clean</code></li>
  <li><code>make hex</code> (to compile and create the .hex file)</li>
  <li><code>sudo make fuse</code> (to set some register values)</li>
  <li><code>sudo make flash</code> (to load the .hex file on the micro)</li>
</ol>

<p>If you use <code>sudo make program</code> you will do bot <em>fuse</em> and <em>flash</em>.</p>

<p>After programming the micro you can desolder J1. See <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/content/projects/fabispkey/hw/fabispkey/docs/
fabisp_tbrd.png">this 
image</a> again.</p>

<h4 id="conclusions"><strong>Conclusions</strong></h4>
<p>I really enjoyed to product this little key. I always wanted to learn to make 
an electronic device from scracth. Now, what I need is to learn how to 
design a board. I can wait few weeks :)</p>
